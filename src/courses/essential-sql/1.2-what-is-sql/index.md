## What is SQL

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a specialized programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases (we will cover what is relational databases in the next lesson). Its importance lies in its role as the standard language for interacting with databases, allowing users to perform various operations such as retrieving, updating, and managing data.

And because SQL is such a useful tool, primary users of SQL range from non-technical to highly technical professionals. For example:

- Database Administrators
- Data Analysts
- Data Scientists
- Software Developers
- Business Analysts
- Product Managers
- Financial Analysts
- Marketing Professionals

Throughout this course, we will cover everything you need to know in order to become proficient in SQL with fun challenges.
