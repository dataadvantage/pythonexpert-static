## Numbers in Python

Python provides several built-in numeric data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.

### Integers

Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. In Python, integers are represented by the `int` data type. You can use integers to represent counts, scores, and other discrete values in your programs. For example:

```python
# Example of integers
x = 5
y = -3
z = 0
```

### Floating-Point Numbers

Floating-point numbers are numbers with a decimal point that can be positive, negative, or zero. In Python, floats are represented by the `float` data type. You can use floats to represent measurements, ratios, and other continuous values in your programs. For example:

```python
# Example of floating-point numbers
x = 3.5
y = -2.25
z = 0.0
```

### Complex Numbers

<div class="alert-info text-sm">
We won't be using complex numbers in this course and rarely in real-life scenarios. You can skip complex numbers if you'd like.
</div>

Complex numbers have both a real and an imaginary part.

```python
# Example of complex numbers
x = 2 + 3j
y = -1 - 4j
z = 0 + 2j
```
